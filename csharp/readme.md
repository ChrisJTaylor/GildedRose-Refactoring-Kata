# CSharp attempt

I split this into separate projects for the App and the Tests, in order to make it easier to run the `Stryker` mutation test tool.

This is my first exploration into mutation tests. I consider myself to be a strong TDD-er, so I was keen to see what kind of results I would get. 

While these results are good, I was expecting to see some issues due to this exercise involving retrofitting some tests. There is always a chance to miss something.

I imagine mutation tests are more valuable the higher your code coverage is. Assuming your coverage is high, if the mutation tests show an issue, 
does that illustrate that TDD was not likely employed?

I'll try this out on other code bases and see what comes out of it.
